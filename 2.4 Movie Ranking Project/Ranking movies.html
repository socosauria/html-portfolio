<h3>Howls moving castle!</h3>

<p>With her country's peace constantly under threat, Sophie, a lively but unloved milliner, catches the attention of an unexpected defender. But as the wide-eyed damsel in distress crosses paths with handsome Howl, a talented young magician with excess emotional baggage, a fit of jealousy turns the hat maker's world upside down forever. Now, stained by the indelible mark of the wicked Witch of the Waste, Sophie must move mountains to break the pitiless spell, including facing her fears and the mysterious sorcerer.</p>

<h3>The flight of the phoenix</h3>

<p>A cargo plane goes down in a sandstorm in the Sahara with less than a dozen men on board. One of the passengers is an airplane designer who comes up with the idea of ripping off the undamaged wing and using it as the basis for an airplane they will build to escape before their food and water run out.</p>

<h3>Porco Rosso</h3>

<p>A short time ago, World War I fighter ace Porco Rosso was a valiant Italian Air Force pilot. Nowadays, the ghosts of the past have transformed the mustachioed man of action into a jaded opportunist fighting for a paycheck as a bounty hunter. And haunted by guilt, Porco flies his nimble Savoia S.21 seaplane over the Adriatic Sea like there's no tomorrow. Perhaps the cynical former hero has a death wish. But everything will change when furious air pirates enlist the help of a haughty American antagonist to bring him down. Now, there is no turning back: the reclusive flying ace must pull himself together and show them who's boss. After all, the legendary Crimson Pig lives for pride, fortune, and love.</p>
